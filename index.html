              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic'; font-size: 18px;">The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives,[1] which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors. As of March 2021, Finland had been ranked the happiest country in the world four times in a row.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;">The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The World Happiness Report ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect our happiness.</p>
              <p class="bodytext; column" style="width: 30%; text-align: center; font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: 18px;">Six factors are used to explain happiness, and four of these measure different aspects of the social environment: having someone to count on, having a sense of freedom to make key life decisions, generosity, and trust. Other factors include GDP, perceptions of corruption, positive affect, and negative affect.</p>
